I want you to analyze the following implementation of the code. Your task is to sequentially adopt the perspectives of three distinct experts:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Experienced Software Developer
Focus areas:

    Code readability and maintainability

    Modularity and structure

    Use of language-specific best practices and naming conventions

    Opportunities for refactoring or simplification

Provide detailed observations and actionable suggestions to improve code quality and maintainability.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Security Engineer
Focus areas:

    Input validation and sanitization

    Potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, data exposure, unsafe handling)

    Secure error handling and logging

    Use (or absence) of security-relevant practices (e.g., encryption, access controls)

Highlight any risks or red flags, and offer concrete steps to enhance security posture.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Performance Specialist
Focus areas:

    Time and space complexity

    Efficiency of data handling and algorithms

    Scalability and potential bottlenecks

    Opportunities for optimization (caching, batching, parallelism, etc.)

Assess how the function performs under different loads and suggest specific performance improvements.

Please structure your response in three separate sections based on the roles above.

Below is the code to review:

function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
