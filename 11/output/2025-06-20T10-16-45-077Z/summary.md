A 25-year-old healthy engineering student and part-time postman presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, recurring for three days. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and notes occasional radiation to the neck. There are no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or other systemic symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu. There is a significant family history: his father died from a heart attack two weeks ago, which heightens his concern. He does not smoke, use recreational drugs, or have significant medical history. Physical exam and tests including ECG and possible blood work are planned to evaluate cardiac function. The physician reassures the patient and advises against excessive worry until test results are available.
