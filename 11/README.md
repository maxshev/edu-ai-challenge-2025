# Audio Transcription and Analysis Tool

This Node.js application transcribes audio files using OpenAI's Whisper API, generates summaries using GPT-4, and performs analysis on the transcribed text.

## Features

- Audio transcription using OpenAI Whisper API
- Summary generation using GPT-4
- Text analysis including:
  - Word count
  - Speaking speed (words per minute)
  - Frequently mentioned topics
- Results saved in separate timestamped folders
- Console output of summary and analysis

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Build the TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

Run the application with an audio file as an argument:

```bash
npm start -- path/to/your/audio/file.mp3
```

Or using ts-node directly:

```bash
npm run dev -- path/to/your/audio/file.mp3
```

The application will:
1. Create a new timestamped folder in the `output` directory
2. Transcribe the audio file
3. Generate a summary
4. Perform analysis
5. Save all results in the output folder
6. Display the summary and analysis in the console

## Output Files

For each run, the following files are created in a timestamped folder under `output/`:
- `transcription.md`: The full transcription of the audio
- `summary.md`: A concise summary generated by GPT-4
- `analysis.json`: Analysis results including word count, speaking speed, and frequent topics

## Example Analysis Output

```json
{
  "word_count": 1280,
  "speaking_speed_wpm": 132,
  "frequently_mentioned_topics": [
    { "topic": "Customer Onboarding", "mentions": 6 },
    { "topic": "Q4 Roadmap", "mentions": 4 },
    { "topic": "AI Integration", "mentions": 3 }
  ]
}
