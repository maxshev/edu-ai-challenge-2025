   - Date string format validation
   - Edge cases

2. BooleanValidator could use more test cases for:
   - Optional value handling
   - Edge cases

3. NumberValidator needs additional tests for:
   - Edge cases around min/max values
   - NaN handling

Overall Assessment:
The library has good test coverage (>80%) for most components, with core functionality well tested. The DateValidator requires additional test coverage to meet the project's quality standards.
