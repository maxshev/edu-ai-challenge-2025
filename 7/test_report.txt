Note: The actual coverage report will be generated when running the tests.
To generate the report, run:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage thresholds are set to:
- Branches: 60%
- Functions: 60%
- Lines: 60%
- Statements: 60%

Any coverage below these thresholds will cause the tests to fail.
