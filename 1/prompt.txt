You are an expert system architect. Analyze the following project requirements using Chain-of-Thought reasoning to recommend the most suitable type of database.

Requirements:
- Social platform with millions of users
- Must store user profiles, posts, and connections between users (like friends/followers)
- High data read speed is required
- 80% of operations are reads, 20% are writes
- Scalability is crucial as the user base grows

Please think step-by-step, considering:
1. What each requirement implies
2. What types of databases exist (e.g., relational, NoSQL - document, key-value, graph, etc.)
3. Which type best meets each requirement
4. Your final justified recommendation

Use clear, structured reasoning and explain your logic at every step.
